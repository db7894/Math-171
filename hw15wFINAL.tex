\begin{problem}[18.3.13]
Let $$ R = \{ p \in \mathbb{Q}[x] \vert p(0) \in  \mathbb{Z} \}. $$
In other words, $R$ consists of those polynomials with rational coefficients whose constant term is an integer. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Is $R$ an integral domain?
\item What are the units of $R$?
\item Is $x$ irreducible in $R$? Is $x$ a product of irreducibles? Why?
\item Is $x$ prime in $R$? is $R$ a UFD? Why?
\item What are the elements of $\langle x \rangle$? Describe them explicitly. 
\item What are the elements of $R/\langle x \rangle$? Can you find an explicit zero divisor in this ring?
\item Is $R$ noetherian? Why?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[19.2.8]
Let $\mathbb{F}_7 = \mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z}$ be the field with seven elements, and let $f,g \in \mathbb{F}_7[x]$ be defined by $f(x) = x^5 + x^3 + x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 + x$. Is $f$ in the ideal generated by $g$? If the answer is no, then find $h \in \mathbb{F}_7[x]$ with degree less than two such that $f-h$ is in the ideal generated by $g$.

Construct a field $E$ with nine elements. Start with $\mathbb{F}_3$, find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2, and mod out by the ideal generated by the polynomial. Give the addition and multiplication tables of the field. Find two familiar groups that are isomorphic to $(E,+)$ and $(E-\{0\},\times)$.
