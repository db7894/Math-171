\begin{problem}[4.5.1]
$ \textbf{A simple card trick} $ \newline 
\hangindent=1cm
\hangafter=1
The magician has a spectator choose a card, memorize it, and return it to the top of the deck. She then allows a spectator to cut the cards--split the deck into two by taking a set of cards from the top, and then switch the two parts--as many times as he would like. The magician spreads the cards face up and announces the chosen card. \newline

Analyze and explain the above trick using the following steps: \newline
$\textit{Step 1}$: Consider a deck of 52 cards $C_1,C_2,...,C_{52}$, and let $H$ be the subgroup of $S_{52}$ generated by (1 2 $\cdots$ 51 52). If $ \sigma \in H $, then define $ \sigma \cdot C_i = C_{\sigma(i)} $. Show that this gives an action of $H$ on the deck of cards. \newline
$\textit{Step 2}$: Let $ \tau = ( 1 \ 2 \ \cdots \ 51 \ 52 ) $ and put the deck in the order $ C_1,C_2,...,C_{52} $. Now, if we apply $\tau$ to the deck of cards, then what happens to the order of the cards? What if we apply $\tau^2$? Show that any "cutting of the cards" can be achieved by the action of an element of $H$. \newline
$\textit{Step 3}$: Let $\Omega = \{ \{ C_1,C_2 \}, \{ C_2,C_3 \},..., \{ C_{52}, C_1 \} \} $ be the set of consecutive pairs of cards in the original deck. Show that the action of $H$ on the deck of cards results in an action of $H$ on $\Omega$. Conclude that cutting the deck does not change the set of consecutive pairs of cards. \newline
$\textit{Step 4}$: Explain the card trick.

\begin{problem}[7.2.6]
Let $G$ be a group of order 539 = 7$^2$ $\times$ 11. Assume that $G$ acts on a set with ten elements and that there is some orbit of size bigger than 1. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item What can you say about the orbit sizes? Why?
\item $G$ is guaranteed to have subgroups of which sizes? Give reasons or proofs for your assertions.

\begin{problem}[8.1.4]
$\textbf{Jordan's Theorem.}$ Assume a finite group $G$ acts on a finite set $\Omega$. Further assume that $ | \Omega | >$ 1 and that the action is transitive (i.e., the action has only one orbit). Show that there exists $ g \in G $ with fix($g$) = 0. \newline
\hangindent=1cm An element $ g \in G $ with fix($g$) = 0 is called a $\textit{derangement}$.
